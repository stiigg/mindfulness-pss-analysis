# Executive Summary (Template)

**Program:** <Program name / vendor>  
**Population:** <Describe sample / N>  
**Period:** <Dates>

## Headline Results
- **Mean ΔPSS (post–pre):** <value> (95% CI <low>, <high>), Cohen's d_z = <dz>
- **Clinically meaningful improvement (MCID):** <X>% of participants
- **Dose–response:** <slope/shape>; benefits increase with ≥5 min/day adherence

## Visuals
- Slopegraph (individual pre→post trajectories)
- Raincloud plot for ΔPSS distribution
- Dose–response curve with CI ribbon and MCID reference band
- Subgroup forest (selected demographics / baseline strata)

## Caveats
- Self-report scales; physiological outcomes mixed/limited over 8–16 weeks
- Adherence-dependent effects; attenuation without maintenance
- Non-random participation may bias upward improvements

## Recommendations
- Maintain guided content and nudges; target ≥5 min/day adherence
- Add maintenance follow-up at 3–6 months
- Address structural workload/culture to sustain gains
